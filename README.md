# KVLite

KVLite is a Key-Value store implemented in C# as a learning project. It provides a simplified version of a Redis-like in-memory database with basic features.

**Please note that KVLite is intended for educational purposes and is not suitable for production use.**

## Features

KVLite currently supports the following features:

- Key-Value Storage: Store and retrieve string values.
- SET command: Set a value for a given key.
- GET command: Get the value associated with a key.
- DEL command: Delete a key-value pair.

Please note that this is a simplified version of a Key-Value store and may lack advanced features and robustness. It is recommended to explore and experiment with KVLite to understand its internals and learn more about in-memory databases.

## Contributing
As KVLite is primarily a learning project, contributions are not actively sought. However, you are welcome to fork the repository and modify it for your own learning purposes.
